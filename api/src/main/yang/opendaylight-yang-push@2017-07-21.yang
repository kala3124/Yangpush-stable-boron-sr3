        "This YANG module augments ietf-yang-push with
        additional parameters required to identify mounted devices.
    
        This model will be supported northbound by OpenDaylight
        yangpush, which will use the ietf-yang-push model
        southbound towards the NETCONF device.

        The establish-subscription rpc and the configured subscription
        are both augmented with a device reference - which points to
        a mounted NETCONF device.

        The active subscription is further augmented with the device's
        subscription-id - as these are unique per device whereas ODL's 
        list of subscriptions has a unique ID across all devices.";
